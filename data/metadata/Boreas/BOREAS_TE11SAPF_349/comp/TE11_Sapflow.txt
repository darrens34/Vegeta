1. Data Set Overview

This data set describes the sap flow measurements collected by Terrestrial 
Ecology (TE)-11 in the Southern Study Area (SSA).

1.1 Data Set Identification

BOREAS TE-11 Sap Flow Data

1.2 Data Set Introduction

The Terrestrial Ecology (TE)-11 team took measurements of sap flow were 
conducted at the BOReal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) SSA Old Jack Pine 
(OJP) site during the growing seasons of 1993 and 1994 using hand-made probes.

1.3 Objective/Purpose

The purposes of the work were to:

1)  Measure the average sap flow velocity in six trees.

2)  Calculate the sap flow from the velocity and the sapwood area.

1.4 Summary of Parameters

Sap flow measurements were taken at the SSA-OJP site on Julian days 236 to 245 
in 1993 and Julian days 118 to 259 in 1994.  Stand transpiration is computed in 
mm/hour for each of the measured trees.

Sapwood area on TE-11's site was taken as 12.3 m2/ha. This figure may change 
according to new biometric data.

1.5 Discussion

The TE-11 team's aim is to compare these data with a micrometeorological 
(micormet) estimate of tree transpiration (H20 flux above the forest minus H2O 
flux above the soil)  If the comparison is good, these data will be used to fill 
out gaps that occurred when the micromet measurements were not operating.

3. Theory of Measurements

Two cylindrical probes were inserted perpendicular to the tree trunk; one was 
continuously heated, while the other was not. Each probe contained a copper-
constantan junction. The two constantan wires were connected together, and the 
voltage between the two copper wires was measured proportional to the 
temperature difference between the two probes. It was then transformed into an 
averaged sap velocity using a formula that was independent of the tree species. 
Then, sap flow was calculated as the product of sap velocity by the sapwood 
area. 

From these measurements, stand sapwood area was 12.3 m2/ha for a basal area of 
22.5 m2/ha. 

Diameter of the probes: 2 mm. Length of the probes: 20 mm (usually). 

Resistance of the constantan wire: about 10 ohms.

The temperature difference between the probes was about 12 °C during the night, 
and it decreased during the day.                                               

4. Equipment

copper-constantan junction. The two constantan wires were connected together, 
and we measured the voltage. between the two copper wires was measured 
proportional to the temperature difference between the two probes. It was then 
transformed into an averaged sap velocity using a formula that was independent 
of the tree species. Finally, sap flow was calculated as the product of sap 
velocity by the sapwood area.

7.2 Temporal Characteristics


7.2.1 Temporal Coverage

Measurements were taken every 15 minutes, from day 236 to day 245, in 1993, and 
measurements were taken every 30 minutes, from day 118 to day 259, in 1994. 

In 1994, the first data were not reliable because the sensors  took some time to 
reach equilibrium and because alternating freezing and thawing gave strange 
results.  In 1994, data were taken from day 120 and may not be very good until 
day 125.

the companion data definition file (te11sapf.def).

9. Data Manipulations

9.1 Formulae

None.

9.1.1 Derivation Techniques and Algorithms

The thermocouples gave an voltage representing the temperature difference DT. At 
present, there is no record of the absolute temperature of the trunk, so a 
constant factor was assumed for converting voltage to temperature difference: 
voltage in mV was multiplied by 25 to obtain DT in degrees Celsius. DT was 
called the actual temperature difference and DTM the maximum temperature 
difference (for a transpiration assumed to be zero).  This was done directly in 
the program of the data logger.

U, the average sap velocity, is computed as:

U = 119*(DTM/DT-1)1.23  and is expressed in micrometers/second              (1)
\
F, the sap flow, is computed as:

F = U*SA*AK,                                                              (2)

where SA (sapwood area) is 1.23E-3 m2/m2, m2 of trunk per m2 of ground

AK = 3600*1E-3 transforms micrometers per second into mm/hour 

9.2 Data Processing Sequence

The raw data were stored by the data logger. The data were then downloaded on 
the hard disk of a portable PC in a file named fluxseve.dat. This file was 
edited with Word for Windows, resulting in a file called fsevexxx.dat. Then a 
program called fsev94.bas produced an easy-to-read file called ojpstx_94.dat, 
containing raw data. This file was checked for errors and edited if necessary.

The data were then processed by a program called dtmse294.bas, which computed 
the maximum nighttime values of DT (DTMAX), where DT is the temperature 
difference between the sensors. Then another program, dtmm.bas, computed a new 
set of DTMAX, in the following way. First, the local maxima of DTMAX were 
calculated, and then the new DTMAX were calculated by linear interpolation 
between these local maxima, and stored in a file called " dtmnx.dat". This 
procedure has the advantage of not taking into account nights during which a 
significant transpiration occurs, which leads to decreased (and erroneous) 
values of DTMAX.

Finally, a program called fsevf394.bas computed sap flows from the raw data in 
file ojpstx.dat and from the DTMAX in the file called dtmnx.dat. The resultant 
sap flow files are called sapfx_94.dat (x=1 or 2). The two sap flow files were 
merged into a single file called sfojp94.dat (standing for Sap Flow of Old Jack 
Pine in 1994). The data from this final file were sent to BORIS. Raw data and 
intermediate data are available on request.

9.3.2 Calculated Variables

9.4 Graphs and Plots

QuattroPro for windows was used to produce graphs. There is not an easy way to 
make them accessible (other than by giving the cumbersome QP files). Graphs 
produced were:

- Diurnal values of sap flow and potential evaporation (computed from the 
metstation data and standard Penman formula).                                     

- The ratio of diurnal values of sap flow and potential evaporation, which 
increased from 0.1 in the beginning of May to a maximum of 0.3 in July and 
decreased to below 0.2 in mid-September.  

10. Errors

10.1 Sources of Error

One possible source is the accuracy in the measurement of the voltage, 250 to 
500 microvolts. This did not seem to be a problem with the Campbell data logger. 
The second source is the assumption of a zero transpiration at night, necessary 
to get the maximum temperature difference DTM, and the drift of DTM with time. 
The above-described procedure should make the best use of the data.

Another source of error may come from the sample of the six trees.  These may 
not be representative of the tree stand.  A comparison between an inventory made 
at TE-11's site in 1993 on only 100 trees, and an inventory by Bob Knox on a 
larger sample (50m * 50m) shows that TE-11's sample is relatively 
representative. 

Also, the value taken for the sapwood area (12.3 m2/ha) needs independent 
verification.

TE-11 believes these data are fine when using daily values. The half-hourly 
values are also good, but there is a time lag between the values of branch 
transpiration (measured with branch bags) and sap flow values. This time lag is 
about 1 hour (maybe 1 hour and 15 minutes). Sap flow lags behind transpiration, 
so when using half-hourly values, subtract 1 hour from the time. 

The sensor (1) installed on the smallest tree did not work all the time, and TE-
11 did not use the data.

In 1994, the first data were not reliable because the sensors took some time to 
reach equilibrium.  The alternating freezing and thawing conditions gave strange 
results.  In 1994, data were given from day 120, but may not be very good until 
day 125. 

10.2 Quality Assessment

A comparison will be done between the stand transpiration calculated by sap 
flow, and the difference between the latent heat fluxes above and below the 
forest canopy, as given by Dennis Baldocchi. 100 W/m2 = 0.15 mm/h.  A 
preliminary comparison showed roughly the same values in 1994 as in 1993.

The data file was checked for errors and edited as necessary.

11. Notes

None given.

11.1 Limitations of the Data

None given.

11.2 Known Problems with the Data

Only 2-cm sensors were used in 1994.  It should be remembered that sap flow was 
measured at breast height, and this follows transpiration with a delay that is 
dependent on the variation in the amount of water stored by the trees.  So 
although TE-11 believe that the maximum values and the diurnal values ae good, 
the instantaneous values should be used with care.  A delay of about 1 hour 
between transpiration and sap flow variations was common (see above).

11.3 Usage Guidance

See Sections 10.1 and 11.1.

11.4 Other Relevant Information

The interpretation of the data requires knowledge of the variables affecting the 
evaporative demand: net radiation, saturation deficit, wind speed, and air 
temperature. These data are given in 1993 and 1994 by the mesomet station in 
Prince Albert (PA)-OJP.

These data can be used to obtain the sap flow rates for OJP in the SSA.
