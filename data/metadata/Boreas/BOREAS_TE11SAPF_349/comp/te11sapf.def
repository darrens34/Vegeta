                               the format SSS-TTT-CCCCC, where SSS identifies 
                               the portion of the study area: NSA, SSA, REG, 
                               TRN, and TTT identifies the cover type for the 
                               site, 999 if unknown, and CCCCC is the identifier  
                               for site, exactly what it means will vary with 
                               site type.

Minimum Data Value -- The minimum value found in the column.
Maximum Data Value -- The maximum value found in the column.
Missng Data Value  -- The value that indicates missing data. This is used to 
                      indicate that an attempt was made to determine the 
                      parameter value, but the attempt was unsuccessful.
Unrel Data Value   -- The value that indicates unreliable data.  This is used 
                      to indicate an attempt was made to determine the 
                      parameter value, but the value was deemed to be 
                      unreliable by the analysis personnel.
Below Detect Limit -- The value that indicates parameter values below the 
                      instruments detection limits.  This is used to 
                      indicate that an attempt was made to determine the 
                      parameter value, but the analysis personnel determined
                      that the parameter value was below the detection
                      limit of the instrumentation.
Data Not Cllctd    -- This value indicates that no attempt was made to 
                      determine the parameter value.  This usually 
                      indicates that BORIS combined several similar but 
                      not identical data sets into the same data base table
                      but this particular science team did not 
                      measure that parameter.

Blank -- Indicates that blank spaces are used to denote that type of value.
N/A   -- Indicates that the value is not applicable to the respective column.
None  -- Indicates that no values of that sort were found in the column.
