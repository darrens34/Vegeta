BOREAS TE-07 Sap Flow Data

Summary

The BOREAS TE-07 team collected data sets in support of its efforts to 
characterize and interpret information on the sap flow of boreal vegetation.  
The heat pulse method was used to monitor sap flow and to estimate rates of 
transpiration from aspen, black spruce, and mixed wood forests at the SSA-OA, 
MIX, SSA-OBS, and Batoche sites in Saskatchewan, Canada.  Measurements were made 
at the various sites from May to Oct 1994, May to Oct 1995, and Apr to Oct 1996.  
A scaling procedure was used to estimate canopy transpiration rates from the sap 
flow measurements.  The data were stored in tabular ASCII files.

Analyses to date show a tendency for sap flow in aspen to remain remarkably 
constant over a wide range of environmental conditions VPD from 1.0 to 4.8 kPa 
and solar radiation >400 W/m2).  For forests with high aerodynamic conductance, 
the results would indicate an inverse relationship between stomatal conductance 
and VPD, for VPD >1 kPa.  A possible interpretation is that stomata are 
operating to maintain leaf water potentials above a critical minimum value, 
which in turn places a maximum value on the rate of sap flow that can be 
sustained by the tree.

1. Data Set Overview

1.1 Data Set Identification

BOREAS TE-07 Sap Flow Data

1.2 Data Set Introduction

Sap flow and transpiration of trees were measured in the southern boreal forest 
and aspen parkland of western Canada as part of the BOReal Ecosystem-Atmosphere 
Study (BOREAS) during the years of 1994, 1995, and 1996. These data sets contain 
data on the rate of flow of sap (water) in tree stems during the growing season 
(beginning April to June and ending in October).  Also included are a limited 
number of environmental measurements (air temperature and relative humidity, and 
in some instances, solar radiation and wind speed).  Measurements were made 
every 3 hours in 1994 and hourly in 1995-96.

1.3 Objective/Purpose

The objectives of this research were to:

1)  Examine how forest transpiration at different time scales (diurnal and 
seasonal) is affected by environmental conditions, including vapor pressure 
deficit (VPD), solar radiation, temperature, wind, and soil moisture.

2)  Use sap flow measurements, coupled with environmental measurements, as a 
means of examining changes in canopy (stomatal) conductance in aspen and spruce.

3)  Compare transpiration responses of aspen under two contrasting climates 
(boreal site at Southern Study Area (SSA) Old Aspen (SSA-OA), drought-prone 
aspen parkland site at Batoche, located 100 km south of SSA-OA.

4).  Ultimately, through collaboration with other BOREAS investigators, 
determine what is controlling rates of forest transpiration at different time 
scales.

5)  On a long-term scale, use this information as part of the foundation for the 
development of carbon-based, daily time-step models of forest growth responses 
to changes in climate.

1.5 Discussion

In the western Canadian interior, regional climatic moisture gradients appear to 
be closely linked to forest distribution and to hydrological differences in 
ecosystem functioning (Hogg, 1994, 1997).  Thus, an understanding of the factors 
controlling forest transpiration is especially important in this region, and is 
critical to predicting how the productivity and hydrology of the boreal forest 
would respond to a warmer and drier future climate.

One of the major processes being studied in the BOREAS project is water vapor 
flux from different vegetation types and its control by environmental and 
ecophysiological factors (Sellers et al,. 1995).  A major component of the 
research within BOREAS has been to monitor xylem sap flux (upward flow of water) 
within individual trees during the growing season. The attempt is then made to 
"scale up" these results to give transpiration estimates at the stand level, 
using measurements and estimates of stand and sapwood characteristics.  The 
accuracy of the scaling procedure can then be assessed through comparisons with 
eddy correlation measurements made above and below the tree canopy. 

The research described here was conducted by two members of the Canadian Forest 
Service (CFS), Edmonton, who are members of the Terrestrial Ecology (TE) group, 
team TE-07, within BOREAS.  This work was conducted as part of the CFS Climate 
Change program, and is also a contribution to the CFS Boreal Forest Transect 
Case Study (BFTCS; see Price and Apps, 1995).

The heat pulse method was used to monitor sap flow continuously during the 
growing season from May to October (for details, see Section 3.0, Theory of 
Measurements).  All measurements were made in the SSA.  At the OA site, sap flow 
was measured on six aspen (Populus tremuloides) trees near the flux tower in 
1996 and near the TE tower in 1994.  At the Batoche site, 9 to 12 aspen trees 
were measured during 1994-96.  At the Mixed wood site (MIX), four aspen, two 
white spruce (Picea glauca), and two black spruce (Picea mariana) were measured 
in 1994.  At the Old Black Spruce SSA-OBS site, six black spruce were measured 
in 1996.  Sap flow was measured every 3 hours at all sites in 1994, and hourly 
in 1995 and 1996.

Hourly meteorological data were obtained from the 18-m tower and at each of four 
sap flow stations at Batoche.  Limited environmental measurements were made from 
sap flow stations at BOREAS sites.

In the data files, the column called MEASUREMENT_DESCR gives a coded description 
of the measurements taken.  Each measurement taken is denoted by a single letter 
of code.   The description code is:

“a” to “h” means that trees called “a” to “h” gave good data.
“N” denotes trees receiving new probes.
“x” denotes missing or bad data taken from that tree.

3. Theory of Measurements

Sap (water) flow was measured by the heat pulse method (Marshall, 1958; Swanson, 
1983, 1994; Hogg et al., 1997), using two thermocouples spaced symmetrically 
0.75 cm above and below a heater 5-cm long with a power output of 2 W/cm.  All 
probe elements had a diameter of 1.6 mm, and holes of the same diameter were 
drilled using a steel template.  Thermocouple depth in the sapwood was 1.5 cm 
for large (>15 cm diameter) trees and 1.0 cm for smaller trees.  At the SSA-OBS 
site, a depth of 7.5 mm was used because of narrow (4 to 12 mm) sapwood under a 
bark width of about 3-4 mm.

Probes were located at a height of approximately 1.3 m on the north side of the 
tree and were thermally insulated by wrapping with them white polyethylene 
packing material.  At each station, a datalogger (Campbell Scientific, Model 
21X, powered by batteries and a solar panel) was used to record the temperature 
increase at the upper (T_u) and lower (T_l) thermocouples, 60 s following a 4 s 
heat pulse.  On two dates in 1994 (boreal site, Julian Day of Year (DOY) 192 and 
209; parkland site, DOY 190 and 205), one or two probes per station were removed 
and replaced with new probes at another location on the same tree (all probes 
were replaced once).  In 1995 and 1996, probes were replaced only as needed, 
i.e., following heater failure or abnormal wounding.

4. Equipment

4.1 Sensor/Instrument Description

The sap flow instrumentation was designed and constructed by P.A. Hurdle at the 
CFS.  The instrumentation has evolved from earlier implementations used by P.A. 
Hurdle and R.H. Swanson, former research scientist at CFS (retired 1992).

The system operates using Campbell Scientific dataloggers (Model 21x).

Measurements of temperature and relative humidity were made using shielded Model 
HMP35C Vaisala probes.  

Volumetric water content of the soil was measured using Barber-Colman fibreglass 
sensors that had been precalibrated in the laboratory using soil samples 
collected from the site (Batoche only).

4.1.1 Collection Environment

Measurements were made with ambient environmental conditions of forest 
understories, from April or May to October.  Temperatures ranged from -10 to 
35?C.  Occasional damage to sap flow probes was caused by bears, deer, and other 
wildlife, which usually resulted in complete malfunction of probes in affected 
trees.  Lightning and rain events did not adversely affect the operation of the 
instruments.

4.1.2 Source/Platform

Probes were mounted at a height of 1 to 1.5 m on the north side of trees.

The datalogger was in a weatherproof box, anchored either to a wooden fence or 
to an adjacent tree.

Environmental measurements were made either from a tripod or from a horizontally 
mounted aluminum boom extending from a fencepost or pole. 
     
4.1.3 Source/Platform Mission Objectives

The platform objective was to provide a place from which accurate and  
consistant measurements could be made.

4.1.4 Key Variables

sap flux density (cm3 per cm2 of sapwood area per hour)
sapwood area to ground area ratio

For analysis (including collaborations with other investigators):

hourly in-canopy (derived from air temperature and relative humidity)
hourly solar radiation 
daily precipitation and soil moisture  
leaf area index 
aerodynamic conductance (to assess degree to which VPD versus net radiation is 
controlling transpiration using the Penman-Monteith approach)

4.1.5 Principles of Operation

A probe placed in the sapwood released a pulse of heat.  One minute later, the 
increase in sapwood temperature 7.5 mm above and below the heater was measured 
using thermocouples.  If no sap (water) is flowing, the temperature increase is 
symmetrical; as sap flow increases, more heat is transported to the upper heater 
and less heat reaches the lower heater.  Sap flow is proportional to the natural 
logarithm of the ratio between the temperature increase of the upper 
thermocouple and that of the lower thermocouple.  The calculation also required 
estimates of sapwood bulk density and moisture content, and a correction factor 
needed to be applied to account for interruption of the sap stream by probes.

4.1.6 Sensor/Instrument Measurement Geometry

The heater provided a linear heat source across the full sapwood depth.  The 
thermocouples were located at an appropriate sapwood depth (0.75 to 1.5 cm, 
depending on sapwood thickness).

4.2 Calibration

Calibrations of earlier designs have been conducted on small trees in the 
laboratory by Cohen et al. (1981) and Swanson (1983), but field calibration was 
difficult (e.g., on 20-m-tall aspen trees).  A heat transfer model, similar to 
that used by Swanson and Whitfield (1981), was used to determine the degree to 
which sap flux densities were underestimated through local interruption of sap 
flow by probes.  The primary means of calibration at the stand level was to 
compare results against other sap flow methods and against eddy correlation 
measurements of latent heat flux (Hogg et al., 1997; see also Black et al., 
1996).

4.2.1 Specifications

Freezing and thawing of xylem during early spring and late fall result in 
"spiking" of sap flow outputs.  

The sap flow calculation was insensitive to the quantity of heat released by the 
probe (although signal-to-noise ratio can be affected if power output of heater 
decreases, e.g., by weak solar panels and batteries).

4.2.1.1 Tolerance

As shown by Hogg and Hurdle (1997), TE-07's implementation was highly sensitive 
to slow rates of sap flow (as would be recorded at night); sap flow rates 
corresponding to 5 to 10% of the typical midday maximum can be easily resolved.  

The spacing of thermocouples relative to the heater (0.75 cm) allowed 
measurements of sap flow rates (S) of up to about 12 cm/h.  If sap flow was 
greater than this, there would be no detectable temperature increase at the 
lower thermocouple. Such over-ranging was never observed in aspen or spruce 
using the 0.75 cm spacing, but over-ranging was observed in early trials using a 
spacing of 1.0 cm.

A slight nonlinearity of sensitivity may have occurred as a result of sap flow.  
This was largely covered by the inflow interruption by the probes; based on the 
heat transfer modeling, sap flow may be underestimated by up to 10% at the 
maximum measurable rate.  Laboratory comparisons by Swanson (1983, p. 177) using 
lysimetry with small aspen showed little evidence of nonlinearity, even though 
heat transfer simulations by Swanson and Whitfield (1981) predicted a 
significant nonlinear response for some implementations of the heat pulse 
method.

4.2.2 Frequency of Calibration

Inspections and maintenance of instrumentation were conducted every 2 to 4 weeks 
(more frequently during Intensive Field Campaigns (IFCs).  There were no means 
by which to calibrate sap flow estimates or transpiration estimates, except by 
comparisons against other methods.

4.2.3 Other Calibration Information

Not applicable.

5. Data Acquisition Methods

At each station, data from three or four trees were stored every 3 hours (1994) 
or every hour (1995 and 1996) by a Campbell Scientific datalogger (Model 21X).  
For sap flow, the temperature increase above and below the heater was reported 
1, 2, and 3 minutes following the heat pulse, for each tree being measured.  
With the amount of data reported and the datalogger used, up to 27 days of 
hourly time-step sap flow results for three trees could be stored.  A cassette 
tape was also used as backup data storage, in the event of a power loss to the 
datalogger or in case the period between field visits extended beyond this 
amount of time.  Data were downloaded from the datalogger onto a laptop  
computer.

7. Data Description

7.1 Spatial Characteristics

7.1.1 Spatial Coverage

All sap flow measurements were made on individual trees.  Three or four trees, 
all located within a 10-m x 10-m plot, were measured at each sap flow monitoring 
station.  As part of the scaling procedure used to estimate stand transpiration 
rates from sap flow results, tallies of the diameters of each tree within the 
10-m x 10-m plot were made to estimate the local ratio between stand basal area 
and ground area (i.e., 100 m2 area).

The number of sap flow monitoring stations at each SSA site (Ns), number of 
trees (Nt) per station, and maximum distance separating stations are given 
below:

9. Data Manipulations

9.1 Formulae

9.1.1 Derivation Techniques and Algorithms

Sap flux density (S) (cm/h) was calculated using the following equation derived 
from Marshall (1958):

S=3600 k_sw ln (T_u/T_l)/(x Cp_w rho_w)
                                                             (1a)
where:

x is the spacing between the heater and each thermocouple (0.75 cm).
Cp_w is the specific heat (i.e. value for water is 4.18 J/(g °C)).
rho_w is the density of sap (i.e., value for water is 1 g/cm3).  

The thermal conductivity of active sapwood (k_sw) was estimated at 0.0038 J/(cm 
s °C), based on the following (based on Swanson 1983):

k_sw = (k_w M rho_b/rho_w) + k_dw (1 M rho_b/rho_w)          (1b)

where:

k_w is the thermal conductivity of water (0.0060 J/(m s °C)).
rho_b is the typical live bulk density of sapwood (0.37 g/cm3 for both aspen and 
spruce).
M is the typical sapwood moisture content of 1.0 g moisture per g dry mass.  

The reported variation in aspen moisture content from 0.75 to 1.25 g/g, i.e., 
100 ± 25%, would lead to ± 9% error in k_sw and resultant estimates of S.  The 
longitudinal thermal conductivity of dry wood (k_dw) was taken to be 0.00248 
J/(cm s °C) based on rho_b and the resultant void volume (Siau, 1971). 

From equation (2a), conditions of zero sap flow can be identified when T_u = 
T_l.  Ideally, this is applicable if probe spacing is exactly symmetrical and if 
wood heat transfer characteristics are precisely homogeneous above and below the 
heater.  In practice, it was necessary to assume that zero sap flow occurred 
when the minimum value of mean S in each clone was reached (nights when VPD was 
near zero, excluding frost events).  Thus, a zero offset (z) was applied to 
obtain the "zeroed" sap flux density (S'), where S' = z + S.  The magnitude of z 
was constant, and normally within ± 0.5 cm/hr; it was recalculated, however, 
when probes were replaced.

The heat transfer theory indicates that the interruption of the sap stream by 
the probes results in an underestimation of the true sap flux density.  For this 
implementation, wound width was estimated to be 2.0 to 2.2 mm, including a 0.2 
to 0.3-mm zone of disturbed sapwood on each side of the holes following drilling 
(Swanson and Whitfield, 1981; Barrett et al., 1995).  Simulations using a two-
dimensional numerical model similar to Swanson and Whitfield (1981) indicated 
that with this implementation, a correction factor (a) of approximately 2.0 is 
warranted to obtain the actual sap flux density (S*), where S* = aS'.  A similar 
underestimation of 45% (i.e., a=1.8) was observed by Cohen et al. (1981) for 
their implementation of the heat pulse method. 

At each station, measurements of S* were multiplied by the stand sapwood area to 
ground area ratio (SA) to give estimates of canopy transpiration (E).  SA was 
determined as the product of BA and FSA, where BA is the basal area to ground 
area ratio of aspen stems (at 1.3-m height) in one 10-m x 10-m plot centered on 
each station, and FSA is the fraction of BA occupied by sapwood.  FSA was 
calculated using two radial increment cores from each of four trees per station.  
The zone of active sapwood within increment cores was recognized from staining 
by a solution of methylene blue in methyl hydrate.

Measurements of BA and SA for each site monitored are described in Section 3 and 
given in Section 11.4.

9.2 Data Processing Sequence

Sap flow results were calculated using a custom-designed utility program 
(written in BASIC).  The output file was then imported into a Quattro Pro 
spreadsheet, and bad data were flagged.  Mean sap flux densities (S) for up to 
three properly functioning trees per datalogger station were then calculated.  

9.2.1 Processing Steps

1) Uncorrected sap flux density (S) from raw datalogger output was calculated 
   based on equation 1a using a BASIC utility program.
2) The output file was imported into a Quattro Pro spreadsheet.
3) Data were graphed, and bad, anomalous, or missing data points were flagged.
4) Average uncorrected sap flux density (S) for each group of trees was 
   calculated (normally two or three trees of a given species at each sap flow 
   monitoring station).  Data points flagged in step 3 were not included in the 
   mean.
5) For each portion of thedata set where there were no changes in the number of 
   properly functioning trees and no probe changes, the zero offset was 
   determined as the difference between zero and the minimum S when the 
   temperature was >0 °C.
6) Zero offset was applied to the entire portion of the data set to give S'(see 
   Section 9).
7) Corrected sap flux density (S*) was obtained from S' by applying a multiplier 
   (a=2.0) to account for interruption of sap flow by probes (see Section 9).
8) Transpiration at the stand level was estimated as follows:
   a) Sapwood area to ground area ratio (SA) was determined for each species in 
      each 10-m x 10-m plot.
   b) SA of minor tree species (if present) was combined with SA of related 
      major species (e.g., SA of balsam poplar, a minor species, was considered 
      to be trembling aspen, the major species, for purposes of scaling). 
   c) For each species group, transpiration rate was estimated in each 10-m x 
      10-m plot as the product of S* and SA.
   d) For each species group, the transpiration rate for the site as a whole 
      (e.g., SSA-OA) was determined as the average of the transpiration 
      estimates from each 10-m x 10-m plot (i.e. datalogger station).
   e) Total transpiration was estimated as the sum of the transpiration rates 
      for all tree species.

9.2.2 Processing Changes

Since production of the previous data set in November 1994, the analysis method 
has been modified by incorporating the zero offset and the correction for sap 
flow interruption by probes.  The method of flagging bad data has also been 
modified slightly.

9.3 Calculations

9.3.1 Special Corrections/Adjustments

For each period encompassing no probe changes and no loss of function by probes, 
a "zero offset" was determined by examining the deviation from zero of minimum 
flow on nonfreezing nights with negligible VPD.  This resulted in a linear 
correction (usually <0.5 cm/h) to all values of S to obtain S' (as described in 
Section 9).

9.3.2 Calculated Variables

S     Uncorrected sap flux density (cm/h)
S'    Zeroed sap flux density (cm/h)
S*    Estimated actual sap flux density (cm/h)
TRANS Estimated stand transpiration rate (mm/h)

10. Errors

10.1 Sources of Error

Potential errors in quantitative determinations of true sap flux density 
include:

a) Freezing and thawing of xylem causes spiking of reported sap flow (including 
   negative spikes).  This can be readily recognized in the datasets by 
   reference to air temperature data.

b) Sapwood moisture content was generally not measured since it is a destructive 
   procedure and most of the work was conducted in national parks.  However, it 
   can be reasonably assumed that it is near 1.0 (weight of moisture/weight of 
   wood).  Deviations from this assumption should normally lead to ? 10% error 
   in S' (see Section 9).  Diurnal variation in sapwood moisture content is 
   assumed to be small and should not significantly affect the relative 
   variation in S' (see Hogg et al., 1997).

c) Sapwood bulk density can have a possible error of ?10%, but this does not 
   affect relative changes in S'.

d) Problems in defining zero flow may lead to error of ca. 0.3 cm/h in S'.

e) Variation in sap flux density with depth in xylem or by direction (all trees 
were probed on the north side to avoid thermal gradients caused by sun flecks) 
can lead to errors.  This implementation partially integrates flow rates at 
different depths, but "spillage" of heat from sapwood into nonconducting 
heartwood may lead to underestimates of Sí in trees with a very narrow sapwood 
zone (e.g., black spruce at SSA-OBS).

f) The correction factor (a = 2.0, see Section 9) for sap flow interruption by 
sensors was dependent on a consistent width of xylem disruption following 
drilling and assumes that there was no progressive wounding response (see items 
h) and i) below).  The appropriate correction factor was also dependent on the 
time interval between the heat pulse and when the temperature changes in sapwood 
were recorded (the correction would be reduced if the time interval were 
increased from 1 minute).  However, a longer time interval would also reduce the 
signal-to-noise ratio.  Also, because of this flow interruption, a reduction in 
sensitivity of up to 10% may occur at the maximum flow rates recorded (see 
Section 4.2.1.1).  For these reasons, the correction factor may be in error by 
?10% (i.e., a = 1.8 to 2.2).

g) Rapid, uneven heating or cooling of different regions of sapwood can lead to 
baseline drift.  An attempt was made to minimize this by mounting probes on the 
north side of trees and by insulating the area in the vicinity of probes.  This 
type of error can generally be recognized by the appearance of spikey (or 
incalculable) data, which were removed from the analysis.  The cause is usually 
attributable to a visible symptom (removal of insulation by bears or bucks), 
direct sunlight on tree at a certain time of day, or a weak heat pulse, which 
amplifies the effect of any baseline drift).
 
h) If moisture was trapped beneath the insulating layer around the probes, there 
was a tendency for reported sap flow values to decrease beause of changes in 
heat transfer characteristics and/or wounding from fungal infections.

i) Long-term implantation of probes in aspen (>2 to 3 months) usually resulted 
in a gradual, slight decline in sensitivity, typically in the range of 10 to 20% 
(possible wounding response).  Thus, each probe was generally changed at least 
once during the growing season. For spruce, wounding responses and/or excessive 
resin from holes containing implanted probes may result in a more rapid 
reduction in sensitivity, although some trees maintain sensitivity over long 
time periods (3 to 4 months).

j) Estimations of stand-level transpiration from sap flow data were also subject 
to statistical error (variation among trees and among patches of trees within 
the same stand).

k) At SSA-OBS, the narrow (3 to 12 mm) width of sapwood probably led to 
significant underestimates of sap flux density, because of lateral heat transfer 
from the water-conducting sapwood into adjacent, nonconducting tissues.  This 
would also lead to underestimates of stand transpiration rates based on sap flow 
measurements.

10.2 Quality Assessment

10.2.1 Data Validation by Source

The following two cross-comparisons are relevant here:

a) A comparison of stand transpiration rates at SSA OA for the entire 1994 
growing season, based on sap flow and tower-based eddy correlation measurements 
of latent flux above and below the aspen canopy (with Tower Flux (TF)-1, TF-2; 
Hogg et al., 1997; see also Black et al., 1996).  With this comparison, total 
estimated transpiration of aspen (mid-June 1994 to mid-August 1994) using the 
scaled-up sap flow measurements was 15% lower than the most recent tower-based 
estimates (see Blanken et al., 1997).

A good correspondence was obtained when examining the overall seasonal pattern 
of transpiration by the two methods, and day-to-day variations in transpiration 
rates were similar (Hogg et al., 1997). On a mean diurnal basis, changes in sap 
flow lag behind changes in  transpiration by about 1 hour, becasue of changes in 
water storage in the aspen stems and crowns.

b) The constant power method of determining sap flow (TE-11, Bernard Saugier) 
was operated alongside the heat pulse method at the TE mixed wood site, from 28-
Jul-1994 to 6-Aug-1994.  The comparison was made for aspen, black spruce, and 
white spruce (n=2 trees per species for the constant power method; n=4 for aspen 
and n=2 for black and white spruce for the heat pulse method).

The magnitude of daily mean sap flow (S*) by both methods was always within 15% 
for each of the 9 days, for both aspen and spruce (black and white spruce were 
combined in the analysis because of small sample sizes).  The relative day-to-
day pattern was also similar. 

Differences in the diurnal pattern of sap flow were noted, however.  The 
constant power method was relatively more "sluggish" for early to mid-morning 
values, and showed relatively greater maximum daytime values compared to the 
heat pulse method.  This difference could be partly attributed to diurnal 
changes in heat storage with the constant power method.

10.2.2 Confidence Level/Accuracy Judgment

In general, TE-07 is confident that this method can accurately determine 
relative changes in sap flow over periods of time ranging from 1 hour to a few 
weeks.  Errors in the relative changes should be within ?10%.  This also applies 
to relative changes in the transpiration estimates, bearing in mind that there 
is typically a 0.5-to 1-hour diurnal lag between stem sap flow (at 1- to 1.5-m 
height) and transpiration.

Over longer time periods, wounding responses can introduce additional errors, 
which TE-07 attempted to minimize by periodic change in probes, regular 
maintenance, and removal of low-quality data.  Nevertheless, relative changes on 
a full-season basis could be in error by as much as ?25%.

Error in quantitative estimates of the actual sap flux density is difficult to 
assess, but based on the comparison with TE-11 (Section 10.2.1), error is 
probably ?15% for aspen and spruce.  However, progressive wounding responses can 
result in serious underestimations of sap flux density (such responses are 
usually evident from the data, and are normally corrected by changing probes). 

From Section 10.1, it will be evident to the reader that there are many possible 
sources of error in estimating stand transpiration rates from sap flow 
measurements.  In the 1994 comparison with eddy correlation measurements at SSA-
OA, the estimates of transpiration were similar within 15%.  This could indicate 
that much of the error listed in Section 10.1 is of minor consequence, but TE-07 
nevertheless urges caution in applying these quantitative estimates of stand 
transpiration.  

Tower-based eddy correlation is clearly a superior means of obtaining seasonal 
totals of water vapor flux at the stand level, since results can be rigorously 
validated by examining the degree of energy closure.  However, sap flow 
measurements can have the following advantages over tower-based methods: 1) they 
are much less sensitive to meteorological conditions, resulting in more stable 
diurnal values; 2) all of the flux is attributable to water flux within a given 
tree; thus, they can provide a better means of examining transpiration responses 
for a given species.  TE-07 experience indicates the benefits of operating sap 
flow measurements alongside eddy correlation, since the potential sources of 
error are different and generally independent.

10.2.3 Measurement Error for Parameters

See Section 10.2.2.

10.2.4 Additional Quality Assessments

None given.

10.2.5 Data Verification by Data Center

Data were examined for general consistency and clarity.

11. Notes

11.1 Limitations of the Data

Potential sources of error are noted in Section 10.  All of the sap flow data 
are for trees only; thus, transpiration estimates are not directly comparable to 
measurements of water vapor flux made above the canopy (which also include 
evaporation of intercepted water and transpiration by the understory and soil).

11.2 Known Problems with the Data

In some instances, sample sizes (number of trees giving good measurements) was 
reduced because of animal damage, heater failure, thermal drift, and other 
causes. Discontinuities may occur in the data set when there is a loss of 
function for one or more trees at a given site, or following probe changes.

11.3 Usage Guidance

Readers are advised to examine all sections of this document to determine the 
suitability of this data set for their purposes. Any constructive feedback that 
users may have about the contents of this document and associated data sets is 
welcome.  Scathing criticism will be cheerfully rebutted.  "Let he/she who is 
without error in their own measurements throw the first stone."

Data may be viewed, transformed, or skewed in any fashion that suits the user's 
whim or needs.  However, contact TE-07 (see Section 2.3) before using these data 
for presentations, publications, and related venues for the dissemination of 
erudite information.

11.4 Other Relevant Information

In the data files, the column called MEASUREMENT_DESCR gives a coded description 
of the measurements taken.  Each measurement taken is denoted by a single letter 
of code.   The description code is:

“a” to “h” means that trees called “a” to “h” gave good data.
“N” denotes trees receiving new probes.
“x” denotes missing or bad data taken from that tree.

The format design of the BOREAS data plan template seems to have been optimized 
for fluxers and remote sensors rather than for researchers in terrestrial 
ecology and physiology.

In lieu of humor and apologies, this section is hereby used to sneak in some 
ecological information relevant to these data sets.

Section A: Description of Aspen Sites

The two aspen sites are both situated in stands of trembling aspen in central 
Saskatchewan, Canada.  The boreal site is the BOREAS SSA-OA tower site, located 
in the southern boreal forest of Prince Albert National Park (PANP), elevation 
600 m.  The parkland site is located at Batoche National Historic Park, in the 
aspen parkland about 100 km to the south, elevation 500 m), midway between 
Saskatoon and Prince Albert.  It is a CFS research site that forms part of the 
BFTCS (Price and Apps, 1995).

The two aspen sites differ dramatically, in terms of climate, vegetation, tree 
growth form, and productivity (see Hogg and Hurdle, 1995).  Based on the 1951-80 
climate normals (Environment Canada, 1982), the Batoche site receives 
considerably less precipitation (375 mm/yr at Rosthern, 52?40'N, 106?20'W) 
compared to the SSA OA site (462 mm/yr at Waskesui Lake, 53?55'N, 106?05'W). 
Furthermore, mean growing season temperatures at the Batoche site are about 2 °C 
warmer at the parkland site, resulting in a much drier long-term climate (see 
Hogg, 1994).

SSA-OA Site:

The vegetation of the SSA-OA site consists of an extensive, even-aged stand of 
trembling aspen, 70 to 80 years old and 18 to 22 m tall.  The understory is 
dominated by beaked hazelnut (Corylus cornuta Marsh.) about 2 m tall.  Aspen 
clones (patches of genetically identical trees) are readily distinguishable 
because of differences in bark characteristics and phenology.  The stand is 
relatively homogeneous except for a few small openings and occasional patches of 
balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.).  The site is gently rolling and 
generally well drained, with a predominantly clay loam soil texture.

In 1994, sap flow was monitored at a location about 1 km east of the main BOREAS 
flux tower.  Two adjacent clones were monitored.  They are referred to as the 
early-leafing (EL) and late-leafing (LL) clones, because of differences in 
phenology. 

In 1996, sap flow was monitored at two locations near the main BOREAS flux 
tower.  The first clone (PAA) was located near Hut B, where Remote Sensing 
Science (RSS)-17 monitored sap flow by the Granier method in 1994.  The second 
clone (PAB) was situated near the canopy access tower located about 100 m east 
of the main flux tower.


Batoche Site 
CFS site and Auxiliary BOREAS site)

The parkland site is in one of the few remaining areas of native aspen parkland 
in the region that was never cultivated for agriculture.  The terrain is rolling 
and underlain by stabilized sand dunes.  The vegetation is highly heterogeneous, 
ranging from open native grassland with small, stunted clones of aspen to more 
productive lowland forests of aspen and balsam poplar with an understory of red 
osier dogwood (Cornus stolonifera Michx.). Trees are stunted in relation to 
diameter, and are often crooked, leaning, or forked, with heights ranging from 
<5 m to 15 m (see Hogg and Hurdle, 1995).  Within the aspen stands, trees from 
two or more age classes are usually found (maximum age about 85 years).  Dense 
bands of beaked hazelnut occur on north- and east- facing slopes, but in most 
areas, the forest understory consists of sparse grasses, herbs, and low shrubs 
(e.g., Saskatoon, Amelanchier alnifolia Nutt., choke-cherry, Prunus virginiana 
L., and prickly rose, Rosa acicularis Lindl.).

At the Batoche site, four stations were established along a 400-m transect 
extending from grassland to the forest interior, and three different trees were 
monitored each year at each station.  One station was located in a small clone 
of stunted aspen surrounded by grassland (GL clone), two stations were located 
at the edge and in the center of a large (200 m x 75 m) clone in upland forest 
next to the grassland (UF clone), and one station was located in the center of a 
more mesic, lowland forest (LF clone).

This site is located near Candle Lake, Saskatchewan (53? 43.8'N, 105? 12.0'W), in 
the BOREAS SSA.  It was used as an auxiliary site and had a canopy access tower 
for measurements by the TE-04 team (Joe Berry, principal investigator).

It is located on Saskatchewan forest inventory map E43 N595, on the NW side of 
Hwy 120 about 3 km east of southernmost turnoff into Candle Lake.  The stand 
designation is 819/933, H15b ta a94/S5d BS a94.  It is a small (180 m x 180 m)

Section C: Description of SSA-OBS Site


The SSA-OBS site (53?59'N, 105?07'W) is a BOREAS tower site located NE of Candle 
Lake, Saskatchewan, in the BOREAS SSA.  It is dominated by an extensive stand of 
black spruce (Picea mariana) >100 years old.  There is an understory of labrador 
tea (Ledum groenlandicum) and other sparse shrubs, and a surface moss layer 
dominated by Pleurozium schreberi, other feather mosses, and occasional hummocks 
of Sphagnum spp.  The black spruce is highly variable in size, ranging up to ca. 
15 m in height and about 15 cm in diameter.  The forest is dominated by black 
spruce, with occasional large tamarack (Larix laricina) trees in the wettest 
areas and a few jack pine (Pinus banksiana) in the drier areas. Stem density is 
generally high but variable.

18. Glossary of Terms

aerodynamic conductance - In this context, a measure of the degree to which 
vertical air movement permits the transfer of water vapor and sensible heat 
between the leaf surface and a reference height above the forest canopy.

BA (basal "area") - In this context, the ratio of tree basal area (at 1.3 m 
height) to ground area, as measured within plots in the forest stand being 
monitored.

boreal forest - Northern forest that occurs at high latitudes in Canada, Alaska, 
Russia, and Scandinavia.  In western Canada, it can be defined as a forested, 
cold-climate region where there are peatlands (bogs and/or fens) and at least 
three species of conifers (typically white spruce, black spruce, and tamarack; 
and usually either jack pine or lodgepole pine).  Trembling aspen is often 
abundant or dominant, but the diversity of other hardwood tree species is low.

canopy conductance - In this context, a measure of the degree to which stomata 
and plant surfaces in the canopy permit passage of water vapor, expressed on a 
ground area basis.

clone - A group of genetically identical trees that occurs in species that 
reproduce vegetatively, including trembling aspen and balsam poplar.  Typically 
a clone of aspen consists of dozens to hundreds of trees, occupying areas of up 
to several hectares in the boreal region.

eddy correlation - A micrometeorological technique used extensively in BOREAS to 
measure the exchange of water vapor, heat, carbon dioxide, and trace gases 
between the forest and the atmosphere.  Eddy correlation measurements in BOREAS 
were made from towers (above or below the forest canopy) and from aircraft.  In 
simple terms, the technique involves simultaneous, high-frequency measurements 
of vertical air movement and the quantities of interest.

FSA - Fraction of total tree basal area that is sapwood, as estimated using 
increment cores.

latent heat flux density - The rate of energy exchange (e.g., from the 
landscape) caused by evaporation of water (including transpiration), expressed 
in watts per square meter ground area. This can also be expressed in mm per hour 
of water vapor loss from the landscape.

leaf water potential - A measure of plant water status, inferred as the negative 
value of the pressure required to restore moisture to the cut surface of xylem 
in a leaf petiole or twig when the latter is enclosed by a pressure chamber.

parkland - A semi-arid vegetation zone in western Canada that is transitional 
between the boreal forest and prairies to the south.  Conifers such as spruce 
and pine are generally absent, and forest cover is generally restricted to 
stunted patches of aspen.  Peatlands (bogs and fens) are generally absent, and 
small lakes tend to dry up during periods of drought.  This zone is intensively 
cultivated for agriculture.

sap flow - General term referring to the upward movement of liquid water within 
trees and other plants.

sap flux density - Quantitative measure of the volume of liquid water moving 
upward per unit area of sapwood in trees.

sapwood - Water-conducting tissue in trees, consisting of the outermost and 
youngest region of xylem.  For the major boreal tree species, this typically 
consists of the "wood" formed in the past 10-25 years.

SA (sapwood "area") - In this context, the ratio of sapwood area (at 1.3-m 
height) to ground area, as measured within plots in the  forest stand being 
monitored.

sensible heat flux density - The total rate of energy exchange (e.g., from the 
landscape) by convection or conduction of heat, expressed in watts per square 
meter ground area.

stomata - Little holes in leaves that provide a pathway for water vapor loss 
from leaves and for the exchange of carbon dioxide with the atmosphere.

stomatal conductance - A measure of the degree to which stomata permit the 
passage of water vapor or carbon dioxide, expressed on a leaf area basis.

transpiration - In this context, refers to water vapor loss through the stomata 
of tree leaves.

vapor pressure deficit (VPD) - Difference between the actual vapor pressure and 
the saturation vapor pressure of air, as measured at a reference height within 
or above the forest canopy.

xylem - Water-conducting tissue in plants; in trees we are referring to 
secondary xylem or what the lay person would view as "wood," which also serves 
as structural support for the tree.
